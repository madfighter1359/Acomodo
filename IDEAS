Check whether using global params is right or if local would be more efficient (we are sending data from each screen to the next, but some data is the same. Look at appending? Or having the checkin and out and nr people in global and then the room code and location id local?) -- local seems to be working

Params seem to get sent to every following screen so careful with how navigation and linking is structured. why is the page before being re rendered with every nav

For raspberry pi: everything is case sensitive (e.g Backend not backend, and had to convert location id to lower case since DRI_rooms != dri_rooms. not quite sure why this is the case but oh well)

Maybe implement a global context (or just for the .ts files that make requests) with a settings switch which switches from local to public mode

Booking confirm screen needs details of transaction: probably need a transaction table alongisde reservation table

fix ugly display of dates on android + look at date logic again

warning when redirecting after sign in, slightly weird redirecting

slow load time sometimes for getting bookings

Maybe Date.now() ????

Deal with buttons on booking confirmation screens

Need to handle currency when switching locale (have locale: {name: string, currencyName: string})

Make date selection so it closes on select

Handle sign up rejection better asynchronously, add loading states, success message for account deletion

give names to screens in (tabs) (in ios holding down back button shows prev screen names) -- temp fix called the (tabs) group "Home", probably worth asking online tbh

prettify the please sign in screen when booking

sort reservations
